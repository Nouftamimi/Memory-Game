Memory Game FEND Udacity
It is a game, 16 cards you need to match it with same icons
the time is count and the steps 

Instructions

Keep revealing cards and working your memory to remember each unveiled card.

How I built the Memory Game
I manipulated the DOM with Vanilla JS, altered part of the HTML and also styled the game

created a deck of cards that shuffles when game is refreshed
created a counter to count the number of moves made by player and timer to know the duration of a play
added effects to cards when they match and are unmatched
create a pop-up modal when player wins game
